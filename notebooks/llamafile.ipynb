      "To implement a Python exception, you can use the `try` and `except` statements. The `try` statement allows you to execute some code that may raise an exception, while the `except` statement catches the exception and handles it appropriately.\n",

      "    # code that may raise an exception\n",

      "```python\n",
      "class CustomException(Exception):\n",
      "    pass\n",
      "\n",

      "    except CustomException as e:\n",
      "        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `some_function()` defines a custom exception class called `CustomException` and raises it when an error occurs. The `except` block catches the `CustomException` and prints an error message with the exception details.</s>\n"
